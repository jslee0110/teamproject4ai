[Benetech - Making Graphs Accessible]
The competition our team chose for the finals is ‘Benetech - Making Graphs Accessible’ from Kaggle. 
The purpose of this competition is extracting information from educational materials of science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields. 
In this case graphs ,which are complex visual data, are inaccessible for students with learning, physical, or visual disability. 
According to this, the goal is to develop an automatic solution from the provided data set containing four types of charts commonly found in STEM textbooks.

Our final model is a hybrid model of donut and resnet50.
